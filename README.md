# What is this repository?
This repository contains various live coding examples of selected predictive machine learning modelling techniques. In particular, the course covers various regression methods and classification methods. Through an analytical and competitive comparison of these machine learning techniques, lecturers and students can apply these approaches to individualised use case data, adapt and even extend the code units. Students can learn how individual machine learning models can react to different data and that a differentiated perspective on the selection decision of models must always be taken into account. The coding examples are part of the course 'Predictive Analytics', which is offered as a compulsory elective for Master's students at the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart, Germany.

# What can I use it for?
This repository can be used to solve various regression tasks and classification tasks on real-world business data. Depending on the data set and distribution of the data, a selective choice of approaches can be considered. Linear regression and polynomial regression are taught as regression methods and logistic regression, k-Nearest-Neighbour, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines and initial approaches of the CART Decision Tree are taught as classification methods. Depending on the task, two differently pre-processed and transformed open source data from Kaggle were used for the modelling:
Flight Price Prediction for Regression Tasks:

Employee Future Prediction

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tejashvi14/employee-future-prediction 

The code examples in the repository can be applied to various business use cases. Lecturers can use this repository to teach students the mindset of analytical comparison of machine learning methods in the predictive domain.

# What do I need in order to use it?
This program has been written in Python by using Jupyter Notebook. Please download Jupyter Notebook (e.g. via the Anaconda distribution) together with the corresponding datasets to use the code units. Integrated libaries and packages need to be installed.
