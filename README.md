# Predictive-Analytics_HOH_ABBA
This repository shows the application of renowned Predictive Analytics techniques applied on open source business data 

# What is this repository?
This repository contains a program called 'Decision Tree Teaching Assistant' (DeTTA), which generates synthetic tabular
data on which decision trees can be calculated. It is written in the Python programming language and published under a
Creative Commons license. Start the program by running the main.py module.

# What can I use it for?
You can use this software to create an infinite amount of decision tree calculation tasks with varying size and
complexity. Additionally, solution visualization in various formats (JPG, PDF, SVG, DOT) and abbreviated and extensive
step-by-step calculations in TXT format to guide you in teaching or your students in self-learning are also being
generated.

# What do I need in order to use it?
This program has been written under Python 3.10. Any IDE able to run Python can execute this program. No further
packages need to be installed.
